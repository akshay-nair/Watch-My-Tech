# Watch My Tech
A UofTHacks 2016 submission.

A quick, secure, easy-to-use service that lets you stream the camera feed of one device to another. It is able to be run from an Android app and a website, connecting the two through a secure, remote server. 

It allows you to monitor and deter any unwanted activity near your streaming device. You can send messages to your streaming device and receive automatic notifications when faces are detected in the video feed.
